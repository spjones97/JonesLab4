# Instructions

In this lab, you'll incorporate both CSS positioning and HTML5/CSS3 lists, links, and navigation techniques to create a website layout including a multi-level navigation bar. I've given you an index.html to start with, populated with all the HTML you'll need, and you'll customize the content and add CSS for styling and layout to make it look like the layout in the attached image.

As you work, you should change the actual content (text, photos, colors, fonts, icons) in the HTML, but try not to change the tagging scheme. You should try to use all the classes, IDs, and divs present in this HTML document. Therefore, before you start work, read through the HTML carefully. Where are classes reused? Why? How can you create classes that will be useful across multiple different elements? When are container elements created? Why? How can you use container elements to facilitate the layout of your page?That said, if you find you understand exactly what's going on in the HTML, but you come up with a scheme that replicates the results but works better for you, that's fine--just add a note to your submission and explain!

Note: you can accomplish all this with only lists, links, and positioning. Please do not use flexbox, CSS grid, or other methods, even if you know how to use them. We'll get to those later!

# Here are the steps:

* Create a root directory (project folder) called YourLastNameLab4.
* Download the index.html document attached to this assignment and place it inside your root directory. You can also create your own index.html and populate it with the HTML found here: https://codepen.io/tkjn/pen/jdYqQr?editors=1000, which is the same thing.
* Create a stylesheet called styles.css and place it, too, inside the root directory. Check the <link> element in the <head> of your HTML document to ensure it points directly to your new stylesheet.
* Download the image file attached below and review it to see what you're going for.
* Add CSS to your stylesheet to create a similar layout to what you see in the image. You should make sure that
* You use HTML lists to create the navigation menu
* At least one of your navbar items has a dropdown list with at least three items in it, each of which should be an <a> element
* Your navbar items change color when hovered over
* The dropdown menu items change color when hovered over
* The navigation menu remains at the top of the page when you scroll
* The dropdown list items do not hide behind the main content area
* Your navbar items and the "thing" content areas stack when you make your browser narrower
* Nothing crazy happens when you make your browser narrower
Important note: It is possible to create this layout using only the HTML and classes included in the index.html starter code provided here. However, you're not required to use only that HTML and those classes; there is more than one acceptable way to complete this assignment. Please feel free to add to or change any or all of the HTML in index.html--whatever makes the most sense to you.

# Also: 

* Add a background image to the jumbotron class, the same way you did to create Image 1 of the Box Model Lab.
* Change the icons that appear above each "thing" using Font Awesome. I've already added a link to the Font Awesome CDN to the <head> of index.html. This page tells you how to use Font Awesome icons: https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use and here's a Font Awesome icon cheat sheet: https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet
* I've used a Google Font in this project; see the <head> area to see how I've linked to it. Visit the Google Fonts reference page and select a different Google Font of your own. Link to it in the <head> to add it to your project, and use it in your styling. Instructions on using Google Fonts and other online font services are available here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts#Using_an_online_font_service
